        <h2>The Roman Currency</h2>
        <p>The Roman coin would, depending on the time period, consists of either gold, bronze, silver and or
          orchicalcum. It was first introducted in the Republican period & continued well into the Imperial era.
          Depending on the period, the material of the coin would differ. There have been notable moments in Roman
          history in regards to inflation issues. This lead to an Emperor called Diolectian that pushed out reforms to
          combat it.</p>
        <p>Due to the longevity of the Empire, many different types of coins from different periods remained in
          circulation & in fact, it is the most dug up artifact by modern day archaeologists.
          The vast majority of these coins tend to be from the Imperial period and have contributed heavily to our
          understanding of the Imperial period.
          While one might think a simple coin does not provide much value to historical research, it has actually
          allowed us to document Emperors that have not been documented in ancient text.
        </p>
        <h2 id="nero">Nero</h2>
        <p>Emperor Nero is known as one of the more cruel leaders in Roman history. It is understood by scholars that
          Nero was the instigator of the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD that burned much of the Imperial City.
          Nero also murdered his wife Octavia & as well as her son, his heir. This incident occured later into his
          reign.
          He officially commits suicide, fearing the Senate would issue an execution against him.

        <h2 id="commodus">Commodus</h2>
        <p>Caesar Marcus Aurelius Commodus Antoninus Augustus reigned as Emperor for about twenty years.
          It was his reign that would cause the following civil wars to come, in part due to his mismanagement
          of the Empire.</p>
        <p>Commodus would eventually be classified as insane, naming Rome the colony of Commodus and believed himself
          to be
          the god Hercules. He would be murdered by his advisors, hoping that a reign of tyranny would end.
          It would instead spark one of Rome's many bloody civil wars.</p>

        <h2 id="hadrian">Hadrian</h2>
        <p>Caesar Traianus Hadrianus Augustus, also known as Hadrian was one of the Five Good Emperors.
          He was a Just ruler who admired Greek civilization & is praised for his administrative and defensive
          policies.
          Adopted by Trajan, he is the third of the so-called Five Good Emperors. He is most known for Hadrian's Wall,
          walls that marked the end of Roman Britannia, located roughly near the Scottish-English border in modern
          times.</p>
        <p>Hadrian's reign can be viewed as a relatively peaceful and prosperous one, as he opted to build up
          defensive Roman structures along the border, and personally saw the construction of many of the projects.

        <h2 id="basil">Basil II</h2>
        <p>Basil Bulgaroctonus, or Basil the Slayer of the Bulgars, is one of most well admired Emperors to reign in
          Eastern Rome.
          His reign was at a time when Rome had split from West to East, with Basil being on the path to reconquest.
          Basil is well-known for conquering and subjucating the Balkan region, in particular with modern-day Bulgaria
          Thanks to his fierce statesmenship and an autocracy bound to the character of the Emperor, Basil was able to
          extend not only his authority abroad, but even at home.
