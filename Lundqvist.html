    <h4> Who were the Romans?</h4>
    <p>The ancient Roman civilisation began in 753 BC when King Romulus founded the city of Rome (naming it after
      himself).
      Over the next thousand years, this small city grew into a large empire.
      The ancient Romans became one of the most influential civilisations in history, conquering areas in Europe, Africa
      and Asia.</p>
    <h4>Who ruled Rome?</h4>
    <p>Rome began as a kingdom and was ruled over by kings for 240 years. It then became a republic.
      This means that it was run by elected officials called senators and that there was a constitution agreeing how the
      republic should be run.
      Nearly five hundred years later however, Rome became an empire that was ruled over by an emperor.
      Caesar Augustus was the first Roman emperor. Emperors had almost complete control over the whole empire.</p>
    <h4>When did the Romans invade Britain?</h4>
    <p>Julius Caesar first invaded Britain in 55 BC. There were several battles between the Roman army and the Celtic
      tribes who lived in Britain at the time, but the Romans didn’t have a large enough army and they retreated. The
      following year, Julius Caesar attacked Britain again with a larger army. They still didn’t defeat the Celts but
      the
      Romans promised to leave Britain if the Celts paid tribute to Rome.

      It wasn't until Emperor Claudius invaded for a third time nearly a hundred years later in 43 AD that the Romans
      finally conquered Britain.
      Battles continued for several years afterwards but eventually the Romans gained control and Britain became part of
      the Roman Empire.</p>

    <h4> made the Romans so powerful?</h4>
    <p>Romans had a very well organised army which allowed them to conquer other countries.
      The Roman army was one of the most successful armies in history and far more advanced than any other army at the
      time.
      How was the Roman army organised?
      The Roman army was made up of legions which had nearly 5000 men each. Legions were organised in a very specific
      way:
      Eight men were put into a group called a tent.
      Ten tents were put together to form a century of 80 men. A centurion was in charge of the century.
      Six centuries were put together to form a cohort of 480 men.
      Ten cohorts were put together to form a legion.
      Roman soldiers had to be very tough and highly trained.
      They had to walk long distances to battles carrying heavy equipment, such as weapons, tents and food.</p>
    <h4>What was life for ordinary people in ancient Rome?</h4>
    <p>Life in ancient Rome depended very much on which social class you belonged to. Roman society was hierarchical,
      meaning some people were considered to be much more important than others:

      Slaves were at the bottom of the social pyramid. They were the poorest people in society. They had no rights and
      had to work constantly.
      Next came plebeians. They were the ordinary working people of Rome. Although they were poor, they were allowed to
      vote.
      Patricians were the aristocracy of Rome. They were rich and came from noble families.
      Senators were important people who helped make the laws of Rome.
      Two people were chosen every year to help run the empire. These people were called consuls.
      The emperor was the most important man in the whole empire. Ultimately, he had absolute power over everyone and
      everything in the empire.
      Women had few rights in Rome, however rich or poor they were.
      Women couldn't vote and were controlled by the paterfamilias the male head of the household.</p>

    <h4>What were Roman houses like?</h4>
    <p>If you lived in a city, you probably lived in an insula. This was an apartment building between three and five
      stories high.
      These were often cramped and badly built. If you were richer, you would live in larger single homes called domus.
      These usually had many rooms off an atrium which was a room in the centre of the house with an open roof.
      Poor Romans who lived in the countryside would live in shacks or cottages while rich Romans would live in large,
      sprawling villas.</p>
